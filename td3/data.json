            "summary":"Coronavirus disease 2019 in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients is\nassociated with more severe outcomes than non-immunosuppressed hosts. However,\nexactly which risk factors cause Long COVID in acute COVID cases remains\nunknown. More importantly, the impact of Long COVID on patient survival remains\nunderstudied, especially when examined alongside the effect of SOT. All\npatients have been identified with acute COVID in the National COVID\nCollaborative Cohort registry. We compared patient demographics in Long COVID\nvs. those without Long COVID based on descriptive statistics. Multivariable\nlogistics regressions were used to determine the factors related to the\nlikelihood of developing Long COVID from a case of acute COVID. Multi-variables\nCox regression was used to determine the time-to-event outcome of patient\nsurvival with Long COVID. This study reviewed data from a cohort of 6,416,500\nacute COVID patients. Of that group, 31,744 patients developed Long COVID from\nICD diagnosis. The mean (q1, q3) age was 39 (22, 57) years old, and 55% of\npatients were female. From this cohort, a total of 31,744 (1%) developed Long\nCOVID and 43,565 (1%) had SOT, with a total of 698 SOT patients identified with\nLong COVID. Mean age of those with Long COVID was 52 (39, 64) years old and 64%\nof patients were female. Most of the SOT patients were kidney transplant\nrecipients. From the Cox regression analysis of patient survival, there were\nmany significant factors related to patient survival, with elderly SOT patients\nhaving a much higher hazard ratio of 27.8 (26.3, 29.4). This study has\nidentified the important risk factors that are more likely to cause Long COVID\nin an acute COVID cohort. We investigated hazard ratios of patient survival\nbased on multivariable Cox models, which found that Long COVID had a more\ndirect impact on survival in elderly patients and those with SOT.",

In this study, we take a\nmachine learning and systems (MLSys) perspective to design a system for\nCOVID-19 patient screening with the clinical workflow in mind. The COVID-Net\nsystem is comprised of the continuously evolving COVIDx dataset, COVID-Net deep\nneural network for COVID-19 patient detection, and COVID-Net S deep neural\nnetworks for disease severity scoring for COVID-19 positive patient cases. The\ndeep neural networks within the COVID-Net system possess state-of-the-art\nperformance, and are designed to be integrated within a user interface (UI) for\nclinical decision support with automatic report generation to assist clinicians\nin their treatment decisions.",

            "summary":"The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there\nexist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,\nfew COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.\nAt the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the\nbiomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of\nCOVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from\nCOVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.\nWe extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in\nthe article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a\ndeep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify\nthem accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as\nof May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of\nCOVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that\nCOVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute\nto improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19\nCT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to\ndistinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of\ndiseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from\nnon-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)\nFrom text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms\nand clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the\ndisease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is\ncomplementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical\nimage analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the most\ninteresting AI topics is Covid-19 analysis of medical imaging. CT-scan imaging\nis the most informative tool about this disease. This work is part of the 2nd\nCOV19D competition, where two challenges are set: Covid-19 Detection and\nCovid-19 Severity Detection from the CT-scans. For Covid-19 detection from\nCT-scans, we proposed an ensemble of 2D Convolution blocks with Densenet-161\nmodels. Here, each 2D convolutional block with Densenet-161 architecture is\ntrained separately and in testing phase, the ensemble model is based on the\naverage of their probabilities. On the other hand, we proposed an ensemble of\nConvolutional Layers with Inception models for Covid-19 severity detection. In\naddition to the Convolutional Layers, three Inception variants were used,\nnamely Inception-v3, Inception-v4 and Inception-Resnet. Our proposed approaches\noutperformed the baseline approach in the validation data of the 2nd COV19D\ncompetition by 11% and 16% for Covid-19 detection and Covid-19 severity\ndetection, respectively.",

            "summary":"A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing\nmultisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as\nLong Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying\nscientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no\nstandardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative\nhuman-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with\nactive learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity\nand considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long\nCovid collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long\nCovid by any name (2) when the condition is named, the name used most\nfrequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated\nwith disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid collection is\nupdated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/docsum?filters=e_condition.LongCovid",

While respiratory symptoms have been\nthe primary focus, emerging evidence has highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on\nvarious organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This study,\nbased on data from 913 post-COVID-19 patients in Iraq collected during 2022 and\n2023, investigates the prevalence and patterns of GI symptoms in individuals\nrecovering from COVID-19 and leverages machine learning algorithms to identify\npredictive factors for these symptoms. The research findings reveal that a\nnotable percentage of post-COVID-19 patients experience GI symptoms during\ntheir recovery phase. Diarrhea emerged as the most frequently reported symptom,\nfollowed by abdominal pain and nausea. Machine learning analysis uncovered\nsignificant predictive factors for GI symptoms, including age, gender, disease\nseverity, comorbidities, and the duration of COVID-19 illness. These findings\nunderscore the importance of monitoring and addressing GI symptoms in\npost-COVID-19 care, with machine learning offering valuable tools for early\nidentification and personalized intervention. This study contributes to the\nunderstanding of the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on GI health and\nemphasizes the potential benefits of utilizing machine learning-driven analysis\nin predicting and managing these symptoms. Further research is warranted to\ndelve into the mechanisms underlying GI symptoms in COVID-19 survivors and to\ndevelop targeted interventions for symptom management.

Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and\nresearchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study\nof open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129\nopen source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our\nempirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from\nthe collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug\ncategories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and\nstorage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories\nof software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to\nperform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software\nthat are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.\nConclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model\nconstruction through better synergies between data science practitioners and\npublic health experts.

            "summary":"Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory\ninfection that has had devastating effects on the world. Recently, new COVID-19\nvariants are emerging making the situation more challenging and threatening.\nEvaluation and quantification of COVID-19 lung abnormalities based on chest\nComputed Tomography (CT) scans can help determining the disease stage,\nefficiently allocating limited healthcare resources, and making informed\ntreatment decisions. During pandemic era, however, visual assessment and\nquantification of COVID-19 lung lesions by expert radiologists become expensive\nand prone to error, which raises an urgent quest to develop practical\nautonomous solutions. In this context, first, the paper introduces an open\naccess COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset containing 433 CT images from 82\npatients that have been annotated by an expert radiologist. Second, a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN)-based framework is proposed, referred to as the\nCOVID-Rate, that autonomously segments lung abnormalities associated with\nCOVID-19 from chest CT scans. Performance of the proposed COVID-Rate framework\nis evaluated through several experiments based on the introduced and external\ndatasets. The results show a dice score of 0:802 and specificity and\nsensitivity of 0:997 and 0:832, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate\nthat the COVID-Rate model can efficiently segment COVID-19 lesions in both 2D\nCT images and whole lung volumes. Results on the external dataset illustrate\ngeneralization capabilities of the COVID-Rate model to CT images obtained from\na different scanner.",

            "summary":"Background and Objective: During pandemics, the use of artificial\nintelligence (AI) approaches combined with biomedical science play a\nsignificant role in reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and\nphysicians. The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in\ndemand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical\nfacilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the\nseverity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in\ndetecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and\nDeep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT\nScan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID,\nand Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID\ncategory, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are\nof Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially\npre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)\napproach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for\nextracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and\nthe accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold\ncross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined\nwell-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and\nclassification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its\nseverity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19\nimages and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help\nradiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.",

            "summary":"The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has\nspread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.\nAutomatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an\nimportant role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major\nchallenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,\nthere are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing\nthe potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19\nsegmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven\ncollaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions\nfor annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model\nconsists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on\nmultiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific\nfeatures based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel\nencoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a\ncollaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency\nof given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative\nrepresentation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\ntrained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID\nlesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in\ndice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed\nmethod promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for\nCOVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world\napplications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient\nhigh-quality annotations.",

            "summary":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided\ndiagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have\napplied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray\n(CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable\nevaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep\nnetworks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually\nfrom healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus,\nthere is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a\nlarge CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable\nCOVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia\nfrom 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this,\nwe have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616\nimages including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a\ndetection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.",

A critical step in the treatment and\nmanagement of COVID-19 positive patients is severity assessment, which is\nchallenging even for expert radiologists given the subtleties at different\nstages of lung disease severity. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce\nCOVID-Net CT-S, a suite of deep convolutional neural networks for predicting\nlung disease severity due to COVID-19 infection. More specifically, a 3D\nresidual architecture design is leveraged to learn volumetric visual indicators\ncharacterizing the degree of COVID-19 lung disease severity. Experimental\nresults using the patient cohort collected by the China National Center for\nBioinformation (CNCB) showed that the proposed COVID-Net CT-S networks, by\nleveraging volumetric features, can achieve significantly improved severity\nassessment performance when compared to traditional severity assessment\nnetworks that learn and leverage 2D visual features to characterize COVID-19\nseverity.",

We find that providers\nunder COVID-19 pressures experience notably more excess deaths among non-COVID\nrelated hospital episodes such as, for example, for treatment of heart attacks.\nWe estimate there to be at least one such non-COVID-19 related excess death\namong patients being admitted to hospital for non-COVID-19 reasons for every 30\nCOVID-19 deaths that is caused by the disruption to the quality of care due to\nCOVID-19. In total, this amounts to 4,003 non COVID-19 excess deaths from March\n2020 to February 2021.

            "summary":"This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the post-COVID-19 effects on\nfemale fertility in patients with a history of severe COVID-19 infection. Data\nwere collected from 340 patients who had previously experienced severe COVID-19\nsymptoms and sought medical assistance at private clinics and fertility centers\nin various provinces of Iraq. A comparative control group of 280 patients, who\nhad not contracted COVID-19 or had mild cases, was included. The study assessed\novarian reserve, hormonal imbalances, and endometrial health in the\npost-recovery phase. The findings revealed a significant decrease in ovarian\nreserve, hormonal disturbances, and endometrial abnormalities among patients\nwith a history of severe COVID-19 infection compared to the control group. This\nin-depth investigation sheds light on the potential long-term impacts of severe\nCOVID-19 on female fertility. The results emphasize the need for further\nresearch and targeted interventions to support women affected by post-COVID-19\nfertility issues. Understanding these effects is crucial for providing\nappropriate medical care and support to women on their reproductive journey\nafter recovering from severe COVID-19.",

            "summary":"Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable\nmodels using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other\npneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.\n  Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs\nfrom 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing\ncohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and\n559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification\nof COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and\nrandom forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D\nfeatures extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of\nairspace opacities.\n  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace\nopacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the\ntypical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised\nhierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and\ncontrol cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,\nsensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and\n0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19\npneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild\nCOVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for\nother pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness\nof our method against different compositions of control groups.\n  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other\ntypes of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging\nfeatures derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and\nclassification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis\nof COVID-19.",

            "summary":"We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which can\ndiscriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and healthy\ncoughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact, easy to\napply, and can reduce the workload in testing centres as well as limit\ntransmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a cough\nsuggestive of COVID-19. The datasets used in this study include subjects from\nall six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs, indicating that\nthe approach is widely applicable. The publicly available Coswara dataset\ncontains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079 healthy subjects, while the second\nsmaller dataset was collected mostly in South Africa and contains 18 COVID-19\npositive and 26 COVID-19 negative subjects who have undergone a SARS-CoV\nlaboratory test. Both datasets indicate that COVID-19 positive coughs are\n15\\%-20\\% shorter than non-COVID coughs. Dataset skew was addressed by applying\nthe synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). A leave-$p$-out\ncross-validation scheme was used to train and evaluate seven machine learning\nclassifiers: LR, KNN, SVM, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. Our results show that\nalthough all classifiers were able to identify COVID-19 coughs, the best\nperformance was exhibited by the Resnet50 classifier, which was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98. An LSTM classifier was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs, with\nan AUC of 0.94 after selecting the best 13 features from a sequential forward\nselection (SFS). Since this type of cough audio classification is\ncost-effective and easy to deploy, it is potentially a useful and viable means\nof non-contact COVID-19 screening.",

            "summary":"This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a novel unsupervised deep\nlearning-based framework for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT\nimages of Covid patients. In the first step, two residual networks were\nindependently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients\nin a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm\nfor Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise\nprobability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the\nCT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models\nto obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar\nwith Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower\nprobabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of\nthe Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung\nprobability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion\nsegmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the\nunsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and\n0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in\nthe external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of\ninfection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice\ncoefficient and Jaccard index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative\nevaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach for Covid-19 infectious lesion\nsegmentation showed relatively satisfactory results. Since this framework does\nnot require any annotated dataset, it could be used to generate very large\ntraining samples for the supervised machine learning algorithms dedicated to\nnoisy and/or weakly annotated datasets.",

            "summary":"During the outbreak time of COVID-19, computed tomography (CT) is a useful\nmanner for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to privacy issues, publicly\navailable COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders\nthe research and development of AI-powered diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based\non CTs. To address this issue, we build an open-sourced dataset -- COVID-CT,\nwhich contains 349 COVID-19 CT images from 216 patients and 463 non-COVID-19\nCTs. The utility of this dataset is confirmed by a senior radiologist who has\nbeen diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this\npandemic. We also perform experimental studies which further demonstrate that\nthis dataset is useful for developing AI-based diagnosis models of COVID-19.\nUsing this dataset, we develop diagnosis methods based on multi-task learning\nand self-supervised learning, that achieve an F1 of 0.90, an AUC of 0.98, and\nan accuracy of 0.89. According to the senior radiologist, models with such\nperformance are good enough for clinical usage. The data and code are available\nat https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT",

            "summary":"The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupts the life of many people in the world. The\nstate of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19\nhot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to\nimplement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal\nprecautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the\nCOVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a\nforecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from\nthe Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data\nfrom the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S.\nThe proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among\ncounty clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19.\nThe results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable\n(above 94\\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions\nsuch as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases\nat the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to\nslow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nis the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google\nCommunity Mobility Reports.",

            "summary":"Many people around the world are worried about using or even downloading\nCOVID-19 contact tracing mobile apps. The main reported concerns are centered\naround privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily\nusing Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic\nwithout similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better\nunderstand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy\npolicies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used\nCOVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract\nand analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that\nSocial Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and\nethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots\nof people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their\nprivacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the\nother hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared\nto most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and\nled users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that\nin order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists\nwill need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour\nand trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps\nand encourage them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps need\nmany accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of users from different\nsocieties and cultures to access to these apps.",

However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the\ndual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a\nvisualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose\nCOVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of\nautomatic lungs segmentation, localization/ isolation of lung abnormalities,\nfollowed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and\nmeasurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D\nworkflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL\nsupport for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL\nmodel for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which\nacts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the\nattention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and\nevaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case\nstudies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial\nexperience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and\nother forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for\nthe diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a\npractical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.",

In this work we conduct a\nscientometric analysis of COVID-19 research, paying particular attention to the\nnature of collaboration that this pandemic has fostered among different\ndisciplines. Increased multidisciplinary collaboration has been shown to\nproduce greater scientific impact, albeit with higher co-ordination costs. As\nsuch, we consider a collection of over 166,000 COVID-19-related articles to\nassess the scale and diversity of collaboration in COVID-19 research, which we\ncompare to non-COVID-19 controls before and during the pandemic. We show that\nCOVID-19 research teams are not only significantly smaller than their\nnon-COVID-19 counterparts, but they are also more diverse. Furthermore, we find\nthat COVID-19 research has increased the multidisciplinarity of authors across\nmost scientific fields of study, indicating that COVID-19 has helped to remove\nsome of the barriers that usually exist between disparate disciplines. Finally,\nwe highlight a number of interesting areas of multidisciplinary research during\nCOVID-19, and propose methodologies for visualising the nature of\nmultidisciplinary collaboration, which may have application beyond this\npandemic.",

            "summary":"Most children infected with COVID-19 have no or mild symptoms and can recover\nautomatically by themselves, but some pediatric COVID-19 patients need to be\nhospitalized or even to receive intensive medical care (e.g., invasive\nmechanical ventilation or cardiovascular support) to recover from the\nillnesses. Therefore, it is critical to predict the severe health risk that\nCOVID-19 infection poses to children to provide precise and timely medical care\nfor vulnerable pediatric COVID-19 patients. However, predicting the severe\nhealth risk for COVID-19 patients including children remains a significant\nchallenge because many underlying medical factors affecting the risk are still\nlargely unknown. In this work, instead of searching for a small number of most\nuseful features to make prediction, we design a novel large-scale bag-of-words\nlike method to represent various medical conditions and measurements of\nCOVID-19 patients. After some simple feature filtering based on logistical\nregression, the large set of features is used with a deep learning method to\npredict both the hospitalization risk for COVID-19 infected children and the\nsevere complication risk for the hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients. The\nmethod was trained and tested the datasets of the Biomedical Advanced Research\nand Development Authority (BARDA) Pediatric COVID-19 Data Challenge held from\nSept. 15 to Dec. 17, 2021. The results show that the approach can rather\naccurately predict the risk of hospitalization and severe complication for\npediatric COVID-19 patients and deep learning is more accurate than other\nmachine learning methods.",

In this study, we introduce the\ndesign of COVID-Net Assistant, an efficient virtual assistant designed to\nprovide symptom prediction and recommendations for COVID-19 by analyzing users'\ncough recordings through deep convolutional neural networks. We explore a\nvariety of highly customized, lightweight convolutional neural network\narchitectures generated via machine-driven design exploration (which we refer\nto as COVID-Net Assistant neural networks) on the Covid19-Cough benchmark\ndataset. The Covid19-Cough dataset comprises 682 cough recordings from a\nCOVID-19 positive cohort and 642 from a COVID-19 negative cohort. Among the 682\ncough recordings labeled positive, 382 recordings were verified by PCR test.\nOur experimental results show promising, with the COVID-Net Assistant neural\nnetworks demonstrating robust predictive performance, achieving AUC scores of\nover 0.93, with the best score over 0.95 while being fast and efficient in\ninference. The COVID-Net Assistant models are made available in an open source\nmanner through the COVID-Net open initiative and, while not a production-ready\nsolution, we hope their availability acts as a good resource for clinical\nscientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to\ndevelop innovative solutions.",

            "summary":"Problem: Detecting COVID-19 from chest X-Ray (CXR) images has become one of\nthe fastest and easiest methods for detecting COVID-19. However, the existing\nmethods usually use supervised transfer learning from natural images as a\npretraining process. These methods do not consider the unique features of\nCOVID-19 and the similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Aim: In\nthis paper, we want to design a novel high-accuracy COVID-19 detection method\nthat uses CXR images, which can consider the unique features of COVID-19 and\nthe similar features between COVID-19 and other pneumonia. Methods: Our method\nconsists of two phases. One is self-supervised learning-based pertaining; the\nother is batch knowledge ensembling-based fine-tuning. Self-supervised\nlearning-based pretraining can learn distinguished representations from CXR\nimages without manually annotated labels. On the other hand, batch knowledge\nensembling-based fine-tuning can utilize category knowledge of images in a\nbatch according to their visual feature similarities to improve detection\nperformance. Unlike our previous implementation, we introduce batch knowledge\nensembling into the fine-tuning phase, reducing the memory used in\nself-supervised learning and improving COVID-19 detection accuracy. Results: On\ntwo public COVID-19 CXR datasets, namely, a large dataset and an unbalanced\ndataset, our method exhibited promising COVID-19 detection performance. Our\nmethod maintains high detection accuracy even when annotated CXR training\nimages are reduced significantly (e.g., using only 10% of the original\ndataset). In addition, our method is insensitive to changes in hyperparameters.",

            "summary":"The rapid spread of the new pandemic, i.e., COVID-19, has severely threatened\nglobal health. Deep-learning-based computer-aided screening, e.g., COVID-19\ninfected CT area segmentation, has attracted much attention. However, the\npublicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, easily causing\noverfitting for traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry\nwith millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low\ncomputational cost are also necessary for quick deployment and development of\nCOVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods are usually\ncomputationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a\nlightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared\nwith traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant\nstrengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)\nit has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical\ndeployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private\nCOVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a\ncomprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg to\ntraditional methods.",

To unravel the public\nconcerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter\nconversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19\nresearch efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly\n1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications,\nwe investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in\nthe online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that\nthe quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on\nrising. Scholarly-oriented Twitter users played an influential role in\ndisseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently\nretweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be\nobserved, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to\nmore practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by\nthe governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and\nsociety, in more recent times.",

In this paper, we illustrate\nthe importance of speech signal processing in the extraction of the\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19\nsamples and find their relationship using Pearson correlation coefficients. Our\nresults show high similarity in MFCCs between different COVID-19 cough and\nbreathing sounds, while MFCC of voice is more robust between COVID-19 and\nnon-COVID-19 samples.

There has\nbeen previous research done on applying natural language processing and text\nsentiment analysis to understand the stock market performance, given how\nprevalent the impact of COVID-19 is to the economy, we want to further the\napplication of these techniques to understand the relationship that COVID-19\nhas with stock market performance.

On the one side, public and private incentives have been put in place\nto promptly allocate resources toward research areas strictly related to the\nCOVID-19 emergency. But on the flip side, research in many fields not directly\nrelated to the pandemic has lagged behind. In this paper, we assess the impact\nof COVID-19 on world scientific production in the life sciences. We investigate\nhow the usage of medical subject headings (MeSH) has changed following the\noutbreak. We estimate through a difference-in-differences approach the impact\nof COVID-19 on scientific production through PubMed. We find that COVID-related\nresearch topics have risen to prominence, displaced clinical publications,\ndiverted funds away from research areas not directly related to COVID-19 and\nthat the number of publications on clinical trials in unrelated fields has\ncontracted. Our results call for urgent targeted policy interventions to\nreactivate biomedical research in areas that have been neglected by the\nCOVID-19 emergency.",

            "summary":"The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few\nmonths changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many\npre-covid forecasting models inadequate. It also creates a new problem for\nestimation of economic factors and dynamic causal effects because the\nvariations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the\ndistribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the\nlatter view and use covid indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior\nto estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020\neven though real economic activity has recovered and covid uncertainty has\nreceded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude\nand shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or\nindirectly modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to\neconomic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock which are\nmuch larger but shorter lived. Disentangling the two types of shocks can be\nimportant in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.",

To achieve our goal, we use a\nheterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimator implemented as a Bayesian mixture\nmodel, called Hidalgo. We identify that the Covid-19 dataset may project onto\ntwo low-dimensional manifolds without significant information loss. The low\ndimensionality suggests strong dependency among the standardised growth rates\nof cases and deaths per capita and the OxCGRT Covid-19 Stringency Index for a\ncountry over 2020-2021. Given the low dimensional structure, it may be feasible\nto model observable Covid-19 dynamics with few parameters. Importantly, we\nidentify spatial autocorrelation in the intrinsic dimension distribution\nworldwide. Moreover, we highlight that high-income countries are more likely to\nlie on low-dimensional manifolds, likely arising from aging populations,\ncomorbidities, and increased per capita mortality burden from Covid-19.\nFinally, we temporally stratify the dataset to examine the intrinsic dimension\nat a more granular level throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.",

            "summary":"A newly identified coronavirus disease called COVID-19 mainly affects the\nhuman respiratory system. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus\noriginating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Early diagnosis is the primary\nchallenge of health care providers. In the earlier stage, medical organizations\nwere dazzled because there were no proper health aids or medicine to detect a\nCOVID-19. A new diagnostic tool RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain\nReaction), was introduced. It collects swab specimens from the patient's nose\nor throat, where the COVID-19 virus gathers. This method has some limitations\nrelated to accuracy and testing time. Medical experts suggest an alternative\napproach called CT (Computed Tomography) that can quickly diagnose the infected\nlung areas and identify the COVID-19 in an earlier stage. Using chest CT\nimages, computer researchers developed several deep learning models identifying\nthe COVID-19 disease. This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand VGG16-based model for automated COVID-19 identification on chest CT images.\nThe experimental results using a public dataset of 14320 CT images showed a\nclassification accuracy of 96.34% and 96.99% for CNN and VGG16, respectively.",

First, GAMs can be used to describe the changing relationship between\nCOVID-19 mortality and county-level covariates (sociodemographic, economic, and\npolitical metrics) over time. Second, GAMs can be used to perform\nspatiotemporal smoothing that pools information over time and space to address\nstatistical instability due to small population counts or stochasticity\nresulting in a smooth, dynamic latent risk surface summarizing the mortality\nrisk associated with geographic locations over time. Third, estimation of\nCOVID-19 mortality associations with county-level covariates conditional on a\nsmooth spatiotemporal risk surface allows for more rigorous consideration of\nhow socio-environmental contexts and policies may have impacted COVID-19\nmortality. Each of these approaches provides a valuable perspective to\ndocumenting inequities in COVID-19 mortality by addressing the question of\nwhich populations have suffered the worst burden of COVID-19 mortality taking\ninto account the nonlinear spatial, temporal, and social patterning of disease.",

            "summary":"Long COVID is a general term of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Patients\nwith long COVID can endure long-lasting symptoms including fatigue, headache,\ndyspnea and anosmia, etc. Identifying the cohorts with severe long-term\ncomplications in COVID-19 could benefit the treatment planning and resource\narrangement. However, due to the heterogeneous phenotype presented in long\nCOVID patients, it is difficult to predict their outcomes from their\nlongitudinal data. In this study, we proposed a spatiotemporal attention\nmechanism to weigh feature importance jointly from the temporal dimension and\nfeature space. Considering that medical examinations can have interchangeable\norders in adjacent time points, we restricted the learning of short-term\ndependency with a Local-LSTM and the learning of long-term dependency with the\njoint spatiotemporal attention. We also compared the proposed method with\nseveral state-of-the-art methods and a method in clinical practice. The methods\nare evaluated on a hard-to-acquire clinical dataset of patients with long\nCOVID. Experimental results show the Local-LSTM with joint spatiotemporal\nattention outperformed related methods in outcome prediction. The proposed\nmethod provides a clinical tool for the severity assessment of long COVID.",

            "summary":"COVID-19's rapid global spread has driven innovative tools for Big Data\nAnalytics. These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry\nto track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect\ncoronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural\nlanguage processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease.\nCOVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big\ndata application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great\nnumber of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O\nand Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous\namount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers,\nespecially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models\nthrough different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a\nstorage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for\nCOVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus\nspreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database,\nCOVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of\nthree Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.\nThe data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides\ndata into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the\nConnector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving\nand retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends\nresults. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for\nCOVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei)\nto test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority\nof the COVID-QF framework.",

An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical\nconcepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be\nvaluable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims\nat adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly\nbuild COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8\nattributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition,\nuncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted\ninformation is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical\nOutcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep\nlearning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to\nquickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our\nextensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19\npatients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19\nSign-Sym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used\nfor this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical\nnatural language processing tools need to be customized for specific\ninformation needs within a short time. COVID-19 SignSym is freely accessible to\nthe research community as a downloadable package\n(https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php) and has been used by 16 healthcare\norganizations to support clinical research of COVID-19.",

Motivated by the use\nof CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective\ncomplementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a\nneural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as\npart of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting\nfactor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient\ncohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural\nnetworks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest\nquantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature.\nWe introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a\nmultinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage\nexplainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2,\nwith the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two\nboard-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience,\nrespectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19\nsensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and\n97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance\nvalidation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent\nwith radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant\ncritical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of\ndeep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19\nassessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source,\nopen-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to\nenable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon\nthem.",

            "summary":"Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the\ndiagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19\nworldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19\nclassification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of\nclinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep\nForest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images.\nSpecifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then,\nin order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the\nrelatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn\nhigh-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature\nselection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the\nredundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively\nincorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed\nAFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of\ncommunity acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN),\nspecificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and\n96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that\nthe proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP\nclassification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.",

This virus emerged in late\nDecember 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is\nhighly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and\ncauses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding\nto the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the\nanalysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society.\nNumerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and\nPakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order\nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of\nCOVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies.\nFundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to\njudge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this\npaper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and\nPakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use\nvarious models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential\ngrowth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time\ndependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model\nfitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the\nreproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2\n(approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the\nsubcontinent.",

            "summary":"The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare\nsystems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every\npatient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques\n(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.\nDetecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high\nrisk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already\navailable in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems\nalready digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples\neither. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the\nselection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an\ninpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to\nkeep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in\nCOVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood\nof COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,\nwe propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients\nusing X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where\nradiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology\nscalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural\nnetwork based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly\navailable covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100%\nsensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon\nthe results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.",

The\nproposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of\nconventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of\npre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no\ndata augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of\ntraining/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx\nsystem. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images.\n  Results: The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between\nCOVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for\nCOVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method\nand mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method.\n  Conclusion: This study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the\n3-category classification. Source code of our CADx system is available as open\nsource for COVID-19 research.",

            "summary":"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges in modeling its\ncomplex epidemic transmissions, infection and contagion, which are very\ndifferent from known epidemics. The challenges in quantifying COVID-19\ncomplexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties.\nThe uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented\ninfections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and\nvarious quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even\nmore apparent in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the\nrelevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we\nintroduce a novel hybrid approach Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented\ninfected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and\ndistinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen\nduring COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR\ncharacterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous\nprocesses. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19\nprevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different\nfrom existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections\nduring unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal\ntransmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the\ntransmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented\ninfectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with\nreasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19\nobservations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results\ndemonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in\ncomparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.",

            "summary":"COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe and become a deadly pandemic.\nRecently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for\nCOVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud\ndatacentres and thus remain privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new\nfederated learning scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images\nfor facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first\npropose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are\ntrained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new\nfederated learning solution which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange\nlearned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model\nfor generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual\ndata. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate\na differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we\npropose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data\nanalytics, by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low\nrunning latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.",

A consequence of a twindemic may be a\nmixture of two different infections in the same person at the same time,\n\"flurona\". Admist the raising trend of \"flurona\", forecasting both influenza\noutbreaks and COVID-19 waves in a timely manner is more urgent than ever, as\naccurate joint real-time tracking of the twindemic aids health organizations\nand policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. Under the current\npandemic, state-of-art influenza and COVID-19 forecasting models carry valuable\ndomain information but face shortcomings under current complex disease\ndynamics, such as similarities in symptoms and public healthcare seeking\npatterns of the two diseases. Inspired by the inner-connection between\ninfluenza and COVID-19 activities, we propose ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble which allows\nus to combine historical influenza and COVID-19 disease forecasting models to a\nnew ensemble framework that handles scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our\nframework is able to emphasize learning from COVID-related or influenza\nsignals, through a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion. Moreover, our experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting past influenza\nforecasting models to the current pandemic, while improving upon previous\nCOVID-19 forecasting models, by steadily outperforming alternative benchmark\nmethods, and remaining competitive with publicly available models.",

The long-term model is\ndevoted to investigate the global stability of COVID-19 model with asymptomatic\ninfections and quarantine measures. By using the limit system of the model and\nLyapunov function method, it is shown that the COVID-19-free equilibrium $V^0$\nis globally asymptotically stable if the control reproduction number\n$\\mathcal{R}_{c}<1$ and globally attractive if $\\mathcal{R}_{c}=1$, which means\nthat COVID-19 will die out; the COVID-19 equilibrium $V^{\\ast}$ is globally\nasymptotically stable if $\\mathcal{R}_{c}>1$, which means that COVID-19 will be\npersistent. In particular, to obtain the local stability of $V^{\\ast}$, we use\nproof by contradiction and the properties of complex modulus with some novel\ndetails, and we prove the weak persistence of the system to obtain the global\nattractivity of $V^{\\ast}$. Moreover, the final size of the corresponding\nshort-term model is calculated and the stability of its multiple equilibria is\nanalyzed.

Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes\npredictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain\ndeeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can\naid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible\nand transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on\nrelevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready\nsolution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the\ndescription on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged\nand build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to\naccelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning\nsolutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who\nneed it the most.",

            "summary":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already\ninfected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe.\nMost COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic\nmethod is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images.\nHowever, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to\nlimited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such\nas deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to\nimprove diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty\nis the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive\nannotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This\nmakes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this,\nmotivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19\nand many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct\ndomain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two\nmain challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2)\nthe task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To\naddress them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19\ndiagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy\nvia feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a\nnovel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose\nCOVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.\nExtensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great\npotential for real-world applications.",

            "summary":"The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally\nspreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of\nits first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown\ndistinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,\nin particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms\nare mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify\nCOVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation\nand large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image\ninstances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend\nslice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding\nmechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the\ndisease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based\nframework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the\n\"COVID-FACT\". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks\nand is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to\nmake the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the\narea of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first\nstage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID\nand non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies\npositive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19,\ncommunity acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments,\nCOVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a\nspecificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while\ndepending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its\ncounterparts.",

Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are\ncomplementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an\nend-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of\nautomated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and\nseverity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in\nparallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns\nlearning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our\nnew 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances\nfor 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of\nvolumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to\naccelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to\nsingle-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930\nCT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and\n0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against\nradiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art\nmodels.

            "summary":"In the break of COVID-19 pandemic, mass testing has become essential to\nreduce the spread of the virus. Several recent studies suggest that a\nsignificant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms\nwhatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19\ntest, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus.\nCurrently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on\ncollected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients\nto travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting\nothers along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic\nCOVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people.\nSeveral research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing\nthe symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID\npatients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received\nsuch a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement,\nwhere we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and\nCOVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while\nrest of them have cough. We have developed an Android application to\nautomatically screen COVID-19 from the comfort of people homes. Test subjects\ncan simply download a mobile application, enter their symptoms, record an audio\nclip of their cough and breath, and upload the data anonymously to our servers.\nOur backend server converts the audio clip to spectrogram and then apply our\nstate-of-the-art machine learning model to classify between cough sounds\nproduced by COVID-19 patients, as opposed to healthy subjects or those with\nother respiratory conditions. The system can detect asymptomatic COVID-19\npatients with a sensitivity more than 91%.",

            "summary":"In December 2019, the global pandemic COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, affected\nhuman life and the worldwide economy. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic system\nis required to control its spread. However, the automatic diagnostic system\nposes challenges with a limited amount of labeled data, minor contrast\nvariation, and high structural similarity between infection and background. In\nthis regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based\ndiagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze\nCOVID-19 infection. In the first phase, a novel SB-STM-BRNet CNN is developed,\nincorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated\nconvolutional-based Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block to detect COVID-19\ninfected lung CT images. The new STM blocks performed multi-path\nregion-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast\nvariation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse\nboosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in\nSTM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy\nimages. In the second phase, COVID-19 infected images are provided to the novel\nCOVID-CB-RESeg segmentation CNN to identify and analyze COVID-19 infectious\nregions. The proposed COVID-CB-RESeg methodically employed region-homogeneity\nand heterogeneity operations in each encoder-decoder block and boosted-decoder\nusing auxiliary channels to simultaneously learn the low illumination and\nboundaries of the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system\nyields good performance in terms of accuracy: 98.21 %, F-score: 98.24%, Dice\nSimilarity: 96.40 %, and IOU: 98.85 % for the COVID-19 infected region. The\nproposed diagnostic system would reduce the burden and strengthen the\nradiologist's decision for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.",

However, for the protection and respect of the privacy of\npatients, the hospital's specific medical-related data did not allow leakage\nand sharing without permission. Collecting such training data was a major\nchallenge. To a certain extent, this has caused a lack of sufficient data\nsamples when performing deep learning approaches to detect COVID-19. Federated\nLearning is an available way to address this issue. It can effectively address\nthe issue of data silos and get a shared model without obtaining local data. In\nthe work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training\nand deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare\nperformances of four popular models (MobileNet, ResNet18, MoblieNet, and\nCOVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework.\nThis work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19.",

The impact of the\nincrease in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, and the increase in the\nnumber of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the\nstudy employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May\n24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium\nrelationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term\ncoefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19\ncases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on\neconomic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the\nnumber of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively\naffected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country\nthan the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another important finding\nfrom the study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for\nboth countries in the short-term.",

The objective is to study the effects\nof the local spread dynamics, COVID-19 cases and death, and Google search\nactivities on the US stock market. We use both conventional econometric and\nMachine Learning (ML) models. The results suggest that COVID-19 cases and\ndeaths, its local spread, and Google searches have impacts on abnormal stock\nprices between January 2020 to May 2020. In addition, incorporating information\nabout local spread significantly improves the performance of forecasting models\nof the abnormal stock prices at longer forecasting horizons. On the other hand,\nalthough a few COVID-19 related variables, e.g., US total deaths and US new\ncases exhibit causal relationships on price volatility, COVID-19 cases and\ndeaths, local spread of COVID-19, and Google search activities do not have\nimpacts on price volatility.",

In this paper, we aimed to examine the COVID-19\nsituation in Arizona and assess the impact of human mobility change. We\nconstructed the mobility integrated metapopulation\nsusceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasets\non COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed that\nby reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size of\nthe epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests that\nrapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and,\ntherefore, COVID-19 epidemics.

An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised and\ndeveloped based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcome\nthese limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using a\nmedical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audio\nsegments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes (\nCOVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that the\nmodel captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish between\nCOVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higher\nspecificity and accuracy of 95.04 $\\pm$ 0.18% and 96.83$\\pm$ 0.18%\nrespectively, all the while maintaining interpretability.",

The open source community, plays a vital role in coping\nwith the pandemic which is inherently a collaborative process. Plenty of\nCOVID-19 related datasets, tools, software, deep learning models, are created\nand shared in research communities with great efforts. However, COVID-19 themed\nopen source projects have not been systematically studied, and we are still\nunaware how the open source community helps combat COVID-19 in practice. To\nfill this void, in this paper, we take the first step to study COVID-19 themed\nrepositories in GitHub, one of the most popular collaborative platforms. We\nhave collected over 67K COVID-19 themed GitHub repositories till July 2020. We\nthen characterize them from a number of aspects and classify them into six\ncategories. We further investigate the contribution patterns of the\ncontributors, and development and maintenance patterns of the repositories.\nThis study sheds light on the promising direction of adopting open source\ntechnologies and resources to rapidly tackle the worldwide public health\nemergency in practice, and reveals existing challenges for improvement.",

The study shows\nthat the number of EV charging sessions and total energy consumed per day\ndropped by 40% immediately after the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in\nUtah. By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just 8%\nover the same periods and the distribution of session start and end times\nremained consistent throughout the year. While EV mobility dropped more\ndramatically than total vehicle mobility during the first wave of COVID-19\ncases, and returned more slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean\nvalues by September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.",

            "title":"Meta-research on COVID-19: An overview of the early trends",
            "summary":"COVID-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The\npandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and\nsurfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and\nmanifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from\nmeta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics:\ni) mapping COVID-19 research; ii) data and machine learning; iii) research\npractices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and\nfunding; iv) communicating research to the public; v) the impact of COVID-19 on\nresearchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This\noverview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and\nfocused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the\nlong-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings,\nthe author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are\nmore likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for\nacademic events such as conferences; the use of openly accessible pre-prints;\nthe `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of\nmachine learning in science communication; the public visibility of research\nand researchers on social and online media.",

            "summary":"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) belongs to human coronaviruses\n(HCoVs), which spreads rapidly around the world. Compared with new drug\ndevelopment, drug repurposing may be the best shortcut for treating COVID-19.\nTherefore, we constructed a comprehensive heterogeneous network based on the\nHCoVs-related target proteins and use the previously proposed deepDTnet, to\ndiscover potential drug candidates for COVID-19. We obtain high performance in\npredicting the possible drugs effective for COVID-19 related proteins. In\nsummary, this work utilizes a powerful heterogeneous network-based deep\nlearning method, which may be beneficial to quickly identify candidate\nrepurposable drugs toward future clinical trials for COVID-19.

To do this, we first prepared a sample of\n1040 Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Bojnord.\nThen, through the non-parametric statistical runs test, we show that the sample\nwas randomly selected, and it is possible to generalize the result of tests on\nthe sample to the community of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. In continuation,\nwe examined the hypothesis that the smoking prevalence among Covid-19 patients\nadmitted to hospitals is equal to the prevalence rate of smoking in Iranian\nsociety. For this purpose, we used the non-parametric chi-square test, and it\nwas observed that this hypothesis is rejected. The data show a significant\ndifference in the prevalence of smoking between critically ill Covid-19\npatients and the whole of Iranian society. Additionally, we examined this\nhypothesis in some subpopulations, and the results were the same.",

Besides the loss of human lives and agony faced by humankind, the\npandemic has badly hit different sectors economically, including the travel\nindustry. Special arrangements, including COVID test before departure and on\narrival, and voluntary quarantine, were enforced to limit the risk of\ntransmission. However, the hope for returning to a normal (pre-COVID) routine\nrelies on the success of the current COVID vaccination drives administered by\ndifferent countries. To open for tourism and other necessary travel, a need is\nrealized for a universally accessible proof of COVID vaccination, allowing\ntravelers to cross the borders without any hindrance.
